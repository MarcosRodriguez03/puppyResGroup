-We each took our own pages to work on from the proto. From their we created the five pages and added responsiveness to each one. Each page has a phone, tablet, and desktop version.

Home Page: Everything looks good on 1920px! Responsiveness is also working well and images are responsive and not stretched.

    About Page: The only thing I see that I would change is adding a space between the Our Teams header and the cards in the desktop version, there is space in the prototype. Overall though, everything looks good here as well as responsiveness!

    Menu Page: The menu page looks spot on! Great job.

    Photos Page: The photos page also looks spot on. :D

    Overall everything looked good and the responsiveness was there. Another thing I want to touch on though is that the footer font isn't the same as the prototype font. It's supposed to be Montauk Regular I believe. Great job on the site!

- After the peer Review:
We changed the About Page to make it more like the prototype.
Also, as Sinatha mentioned we used the font MontaukThin for our footer instead of MontaukRegular. Ouur reasoning behind this is because even though in the prototype is says MontaukRegular we thought the MountaukThin looked more like the text in the prototype and it wouldnâ€™t match the format from the prototype when we used MontaukRegular.
